virtual assistant
Hello everybody!!!
Today I will guide you to install this virtual assistant
Note: This code is written 100% in python language
Because the download link is a bit long, I can copy it quickly
decompression password is: 1234
if you don't have python installed, please run the installation file available in the zip file
(if your computer runs 32bit, install 32, if your computer runs 64bit
then install version 64)
To know if your computer is running 32 or 64bit, please do the following steps:
Right click on This PC then select properties
if both lines are 64 then congratulations your machine is running 64bit
If one of the two lines is 64, there is a high chance that your computer runs 32bit
Next:Run the module.bat file so that the computer installs some necessary libraries.
Note:
-In this step, you need to wait for the library installation to go smoothly.
-Do not voluntarily exit
- When the installation is complete, the command prompt program will automatically exit.
Since this step took a long time, I will cut this part out
Finally: Run the troliao.py file and enjoy this virtual assistant.
